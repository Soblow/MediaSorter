# TODO
## Vital
None

## Important
- Similar to undo hide, allow putting back moved items to list
- Add docstrings to functions
- Current indexing method doesn't guarantee any order
- Options menu (history size, main buttons...)
- In-code TODOs

## Suggestions
- Find a proper list of animated formats for imageSorter
- Find a proper list of supported video formats for videoSorter
- Windows/Mac/... compatibility?
- Option to recursively index folders?
- Volume info on UI (like a widget to graphicaly change it)
- For videos, keys to control position / skip sections
- Command line arguments (optional config as not positional, optional directory as positional)
- Multi-action binding
- Folder infos
- Copy/paste videos
- Undo/Redo history list widget
- Popup with folder infos / file infos
- Split global config from directory config, make the global config for "standard" keys (hide, delete, next...), overridable (for ex the def) with folder directory
  - Make it customizable from Option dialog

## Docker-based UI?
- Movable "containers" with config, status, view, infos...

## Gallery
- Display all images as a galery
- Allow to select them
- Same onekey-oneaction mecanic

## Other
- Reverse search button?
